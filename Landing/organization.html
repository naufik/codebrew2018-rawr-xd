                        <p>You must source and old car making sure it is registered, roadworthy, insured and air conditioned for the soft ones amongst us and ready to go on an adventure. You will only need a 2WD car (4WD not allowed as this is a car rally not an off road rally). However, there will be rough and corrugated roads so be prepared.<br/>
                        On the morning of each day you will be issued with the days agenda and route you will follow to next designated stopover. We will make this as simple as possible for the people who cannot follow directions. But don't worry you shouldn't get lost as there will be a support vehicle behind each team to help you along the way. Well that's as long as support can follow directions too!!</p>
